This is a simple XMPP bot to notify developers about github commits, comments, pull-requests etc. 
Also subscribers can send comments to pull-requests, issues and commits through XMPP.

It listens some TCP port and accepts HTTP requests from github.

You need to setup some web hooks in your repo to enable notifications (check out documentation at http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/)
